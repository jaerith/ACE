# ACE
The API Consumption Engine (i.e., ACE) is a metadata-driven engine that will systematically enumerate through a collection of data (via a REST API) and then place that data within a staging table.

# Requirements
* Windows 7 (at least)
* Visual Studio 2012 (at least)
* Oracle DB 10.2 (at least - the database layer can be easily ported, though)

# For More Information
This solution is a sample project that demonstrates the ideas presented in my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/mdd-api-data-retrieval">InfoQ article</a>.
